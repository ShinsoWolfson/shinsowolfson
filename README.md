<!-- Introduction -->
## ðŸŒŸ About Me
Hi there! Iâ€™m a passionate Data & Operations Leader with a proven track record of transforming complex datasets into game-changing insights and innovative solutions. With deep expertise in Python, SQL, R, and cutting-edge machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, I thrive on tackling challenges that bridge technology and strategy.

Beyond technical expertise, I excel at bringing companies from conception to revenue-positive, leveraging data-driven strategies to scale operations and achieve sustainable growth. My experience includes collaborating with C-level executives, building predictive models, optimizing workflows, and crafting compelling visualizationsâ€”all with the goal of delivering measurable impact.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in data, you can find me enjoying anime, gaming, and spending quality time with my husky, family, and friends. Iâ€™m also passionate about exploring the ever-evolving world of AI and ML and connecting with like-minded professionals to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. Letâ€™s connect and create something amazing together!
